My Machine Learning Journey with Project MANAS

Convolutional Neural Networks - Jan 2024 - Utilizing the Deep Learning paradigm of Neural Networks, developed a predictive model from scratch capable of identifying 10 distinct Simpson characters from a dataset comprising 8000 images in Python.

Neural Networks - Image Prediction with Neural Network - Jan 2024 - Leveraging Deep Learning and Neural Networks, developed a predictive model from scratch in Python. This model accurately identifies 10 distinct Simpson characters from a dataset of 8,000 images.

OpenCV - Feb 2024 - Designed and implemented a refined algorithm leveraging OpenCV in Python to accurately track the ball during a volleyball match and also identified players belonging to different teams with precision.

Clustering - Jan 2024 - Implemented the concept of Clustering from scratch to understand the weather patterns in Australia with every statistic of every single day in Python.

Linear Regression - Dec 2023 - Created a Linear Regression Model to predict the sale price from a given data set with multiple features related to the house from scratch without using libraries in Python.

Logistic Regression - Dec 2023 - Created a Logistic Regression Model to predict if a passenger would have survived after the Titanic was hit from a given data set with individual passenger data from scratch without using libraries in Python.
