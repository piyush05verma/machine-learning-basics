My Machine Learning Journey with Project MANAS

CNN - Leaf Classification with CNN - Jan 2024 - Utilizing the Deep Learning paradigm of Neural Networks, developed a predictive model from scratch capable of identifying 10 distinct Simpson characters from a dataset comprising 8000 images in Python.

ROS2 - Edge Detection via ROS - Feb 2024 - Utilized the Robot Operating System to develop a sophisticated Sobel filter for efficient edge detection in images. Also engineered a seamless communication interface, enabling a chat-bot to facilitate smooth interaction between two systems in C++.

NeuralNets.ipynb Image Prediction with Neural Network - Jan 2024 - Utilizing the Deep Learning paradigm of Neural Networks, developed a predictive model from scratch capable of identifying 10 distinct Simpson characters from a dataset comprising 8000 images in Python.

OpenCV Ball Detection in OpenCV - Feb 2024 -Designed and implemented a refined algorithm leveraging OpenCV in Python to accurately track the ball during a volleyball match and also identified players belonging to different teams with precision.

Clustering.ipynb Clustering of Weather Data - Jan 2024 - Implemented the concept of Clustering from scratch to understand the weather patterns in Australia with every statistic of every single day in Python.

LinRegTask.ipynb Predicting Sale Price of a House - Dec 2023 - Created a Linear Regression Model to predict the sale price from a given data set with multiple features related to the house from scratch without using libraries in Python.

LogRegTask.ipynb Predicting Survival of Titanic Passengers - Dec 2023 - Created a Logistic Regression Model to predict if a passenger would have survived after the Titanic was hit from a given data set with individual passenger data from scratch without using libraries in Python.
